## Welcome to the MEDS Capstone Coral Models Project!
Coral reefs are diverse marine ecosystems that provideinvaluable ecosystem services such as storm protection and habitat for diverse fisheries. The coral reefs around the island of Mo’orea, French Polynesia, are subject to many stressors, anthropogenic and natural, and estimating recovery is often variable relative to site and different factors. In the past, the reefs recovered after a combination of stressors greatly reduced coral cover and pre-disturbance coral cover levels returned. More recently a different stress event again drastically reduced coral cover, but the same recovery has still not been observed. This capstone project will identify demographic mechanisms that inhibit coral population recovery from recent catastrophic disturbances and predict and visualize coral community state in future time steps. These deliverables will be included in published literature that will aid in designing alternative management interventions that might help speed reef recovery.
